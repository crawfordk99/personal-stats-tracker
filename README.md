# personal_stats_tracker

# Overview

Sports is something I've always been passionate about. I wanted to learn 
how to make an app that allows you to keep track of your personal stats. Flutter is a
newer framework I've been trying to learn, and I wanted to lay the groundwork for this idea
in Flutter (and Dart).

Here I created a number input screen that asks you to enter fields goals made, and field goals attempted,
and then allows you to calculate your shooting percentage. I learned about creating states, building widgets, calling functions, collecting
user input, creating classes, creating buttons, and adding text in Dart.

# Development Environment

I used Flutter's basic create project template to create the flutter folder.
I did this in Android Studio. I used Android Version 8.2.2 to allow for Android emulation.

Dart is the programming language for Flutter. I used the SharedPreferences package to prevent 
my data from being erased when hot restarting. 

# Useful Websites

Flutter and Dart have many examples on their sites.
* [Flutter Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
* [Dart Dev](https://dart.dev/docs)
* [ChatGpt](https://chatgpt.com)

# Future Work

* User profiles to save data to, and allow for continuation of stats
* Connect to database instead of SharedPreferences
* Either drop down menus to allow for sports choice, or create separate screens
* Login 
* Allow for importing data from other sources (such as school league)
